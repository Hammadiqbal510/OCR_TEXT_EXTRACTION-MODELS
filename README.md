# OCR_TEXT_EXTRACTION-MODELS
TEXT RECOGNATION AND EXTRACTION WITH KERAS,TERNSORFLOW,CRNN,EASYOCR,pytesseract



# Optical Character Recognition models

In these models images will be provided and model will recognise the text and try to predict the exact output.
we have two different models in our repositry
## Model 1
 In this model we used the python library of pytesseract and it helps to predict the text from different id card images.
## Model 2
in this model we have used EasyOcr technique to recognise text in the Nationa identity card image.

## Model 3
 In this model we used the python library of CRNN and it helps to predict the text from different CAPTHA IMAGES AND TRAIN MODELS.


## Model 4
 In this model we used the python library of TENSORFLOW and it helps to predict the text from CAPTHA IMAGES.


## Model 5

 In this model we used the python library of KERAS and it helps to predict the text from CAPTHA IMAGES.
